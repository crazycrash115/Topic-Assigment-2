# Patch Notes Style Guide

- Start with a clear heading that includes the version and a brief summary if appropriate.
- Organize items under sections like "New", "Improvements", "Fixes" when useful.
- Use short, direct sentences.
- Use present tense where possible ("Adds", "Fixes", "Improves").
- Avoid marketing fluff. Focus on what changed and why it matters.
- Keep bullet points concise. One change per bullet.
- Do not repeat the exact wording of the raw bullets if you can rephrase clearly and accurately.
